pdis is a disassembler for UCSD p-system release III.0 p-code.
Release III was a major break from release II, and was only ever
offered as part of the Western Digital WD9000 Pascal Microengine
chipset and related products. Release III was not available for use on
any conventional processors.  Release IV is somewhat similar to III
and was offered for many processors, but not the WD9000.

At present, pdis does not produce output that can be assembled with
any known assembler.
